#Deep One Class Classification
# Abstract

>  Despite the great advances made by deep learning in many machine learning problems, there is a relative dearth of 
>  deep learning approaches for anomaly detection. Those approaches which do exist involve networks trained to perform 
>  a task other than anomaly detection, namely generative models or compression, which are in turn adapted for use in 
>  anomaly detection; they are not trained on an anomaly detection based objective. In this paper we introduce a new 
>  anomaly detection method—Deep Support Vector Data Description—, which is trained on an anomaly detection based
>  objective.
